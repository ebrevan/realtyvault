# RealtyVault 🏠

RealtyVault is a desktop application built with Python and PyQt6 that helps manage real estate property information. This project demonstrates my skills in desktop application development, database management, and user interface design. This was done as part of a project for my Advanced Programming course.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyQt6**: GUI framework
- **MySQL**: Database management

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of concerns between data, logic, and presentation
- **Modular Design**: Each functionality is encapsulated in its own class
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Utilizing PyQt6's signal and slot mechanism

### Key Components
- `DBConnection.py`: Database connection and query handling
- `House.py`: Property data model
- `main.py`: Application entry point and main window
- Custom UI files for each feature (Add, Modify, Search, Report)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- MySQL 8.0
- PyQt6
